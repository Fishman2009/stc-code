# STC demo code
8051 code published by STC

The code is public domain if not stated overwise. The original source code was published by STC on stcmcu.com, stcisp.com, gxwmcu.com, stcmicro.com and lemicro.cn.

I didn't modify any information of the original source, only converted it from GB2312 to UTF-8 with UNIX line terminators.

Hope it may be usefull to someone.
